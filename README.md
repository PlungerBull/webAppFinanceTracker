We are building an app for expense management, inspired by todoist

Right now we are performing some management of the code.

Tasks:
1. Centralize hard-coded values
    1.1 We left it on the auth.schema.ts file on schemas on auth on features
2. Find duplicate functions
    2.1 The delete/edit/create modals for categories, bank accounts, are likely candidates.
